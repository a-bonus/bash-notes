# React and JavaScript Case Sensitivity

- **Import Statements**: Must exactly match the exported names, including case.
- **Component Names**: Must be capitalized to distinguish from HTML tags.
- **JSX Attributes**: Follow camelCase convention and are case-sensitive.
- **JavaScript Identifiers**: Variables and function names are case-sensitive.

Conversely:

- **HTML Tags**: Not case-sensitive in JSX, but lowercase is standard practice.
- **CSS Properties**: Not case-sensitive, but values can be (e.g., font names).

# React Native Notes

- **Starting the Server**: Navigate to the project folder and run `npx react-native start`.
- **Running iOS Project**: In the project folder, run `npx react-native run-ios`.
- **Starting Expo**: Navigate to the Expo app directory and run `npm start`.

## Notes

- For installation errors, especially related to permissions, using `sudo` may help. Check the logs for specific issues.
